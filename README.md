A simple interstellar travel planner and calculator for futuristic space navigation. Useful tool for hard-science fiction fans and curious minds. Adjust your travel parameters and plot routes between star systems.

Mind one fact, however! This calculator does not model stars' orbit around the galactic core**, so keep your travel speeds a bit high (considerable fractions of the speed of light) for the calculations to make more sense. 

** *I doubt that humanity even has enough knowledge about the the Milky Way to accurately do that, to be honest. Technically, the instantaneous motion vectors of stars ARE known (for a lot of them at least), but without modeling the entire galactic gravitational field, accurately simulating stellar orbits within a galaxy would not be possible for long durations.*
